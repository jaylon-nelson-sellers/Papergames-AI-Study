# Papergames AI Study

##TLDR
This project aims to beat players on the website papergames.io. These games are relatively simple, allowing for me to develop rapidly. The AI is not complete yet, so no scores have been recorded yet.


##Introduction
This repository will hold information on my methods for beating other players on the website papergames.io. This website has five games: Battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, Gomoku, and Chess. My goal of this project to defeat players and test optimizing strategies using AI. I will use Matlab to code up the algorithms and test them on the website. Additionally I will use human and other AI to benchmark, the latter being OpenAI's ChatGPT.
