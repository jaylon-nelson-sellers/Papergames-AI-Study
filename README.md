# Papergames AI Study

##TLDR
This project aims to beat players on the website papergames.io. These games are relatively simple, allowing for me to develop rapidly. The AI is not complete yet, so no scores have been recorded yet.


##Introduction
This repository will hold information on my methods for beating other players on the website papergames.io. This website has five games: Battleship, Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, Gomoku, and Chess. My goal of this project to defeat players and test optimizing strategies using AI. I will use Matlab to code up the algorithms and test them on the website. Additionally I will use human and other AI to benchmark, the latter being OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Tests:
Non-Gamer
Gamer
Simple Parameters
Optimized Parameters

Neural Networks:
Perceptron
Backprop
RNN/ LSTM
Transformer

Games (From Least to Most difficult):
Tic-Tac-Toe - This game has a limited number of moves and outcomes, making it the easiest game on the list.
Connect 4 - This game is slightly more challenging than Tic-Tac-Toe, but still relatively easy to master.
Battleship - This game involves some strategy, but is still less complex than the remaining two games on the list.
Gomoku - This game is like a more complex version of Connect 4, requiring more advanced strategic thinking.
Chess - This game is widely considered the most complex and challenging game on the list, requiring advanced planning, strategic thinking, and deep understanding of the game's rules and mechanics.
